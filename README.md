## :house: About the project

<p>This was a another project in my learning of FrontEnd Development, made at first only for the desktop experience. Then, having learned the process of making reponsives projects, I had the mission of applying the knowledge in this project. This one was a bit easier, but also made very clear to me how important is to think first in the mobile experience. I made it with my mentor Rodolfo Mori in DevClub's course Full Stack Pro.</p>
